# Assignment Workflow

You will use [Gitpod](https://gitpod.io) to edit, test, and submit your assignments.
To create a Gitpod account follow the instructions [here](../assignments/setup-gitpod). 
This is a one-time action.

Complete an assignment by following these steps:

1) You will receive an invitation URL from your teacher that will give you access to the assignment.

2) [Create](../assignments/create-assignment) an assignment git repo.

3) [Open](../assignments/open-gitpod) the assignment in Gitpod.

4) [Submit](../assignments/submit-assignment) your completed assignment.
