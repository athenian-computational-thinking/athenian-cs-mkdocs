It's essentially the ranked voting program with some functionality (and the lack of it functioning correctly) removed.
* Needs editing - all previous votes can be seen and if a name is spelled incorrectly, the program quits.
* If there are two candidates with the same name, it only goes to one. That probably won't be a problem though. Also, have a reminder saying voting complete will end it so people don't have to go into the code to find it. MA
